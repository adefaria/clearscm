    <p>Whether large or small, today's software is more complex. Many
    resources are brought to bear to get your code from inception to
    release. As such many different machines, architectures and
    operating systems need to be tamed to work in tandem with each
    other for smooth operations. Thus the SCM professional needs to be
    well versed in Systems Administrations of these resources.</p>

    <p>Our people have many years of Systems Administration experience
    in Windows, Unix and Linux Operating Systems. Additionally we have
    been at many clients so we have seen how shops administer their
    machines from various perspectives. So instead of having 10 years
    of systems administration experinece in one company, thus knowing
    only how they manage their systems, we have years of experience at
    many companies which helps us understand the many ways of
    administrating systems, some good and some not so good.</p>
