    <p>Over the years there have been many languages that have come
    about. Each have their strengths and places in a professionals bag
    of tricks. Perl is very good as a "glue" language bringing
    together various other systems, home grown as well as purchased
    packages, to help build larger, customized solutions for your
    business. PHP, on the other hand, grew up on the web and is
    excellent for web applications. In fact we use it here. And there
    are many shops who have a heritage of shell scripts. We have
