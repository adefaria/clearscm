<h3>JP Morgan Chase Investment Bank (11/04 - 3/05)</h3>

<h3><i>Build Engineer/Software Configuration Manager</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Worked as an employee in the Houston Development Center.</li>

  <li>Worked with Ant, Maven, and Cruise Control in a
  Java/BEA/Websphere shop.</li>

  <li>Worked on a ClearCase UCM implementation team, developing
  policies and standards for UCM implementation and working with
  individual teams, taking them through the process of conversion
  (typically from CVS) to Clearcase and UCM.</li>

  <li>Left to heed the call to return to the team I left at CSC.  JPMC
  says please consider them in futery -- I’d be welcome back.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computer Sciences Corporation (5/04 - 10/04)</h3>

<h3><i>Build Engineer, Land Warrior program, General Dynamics, Scottsdale, AZ</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Became part of a two-man Software Configuration Management and
  Build team administering Linux and Clearcase in a 20-developer shop.
  </li>

  <li>In a pure Linux shop, doing Clearcase UCM management, Clearcase
  administration, builds, build automation.</li>

  <li>Laid off, along with most of the team, because of a work
  stoppage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dell (3/04 - 4/04)</h3>

<h3><i>Build/Installer Engineer</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Joined a 10-person PowerEdge/OpenManage installer team.</li>

  <li>Although originally hired to fix java bugs in an older suite
  installer, I worked with InstallShield DevStudio 9, setting up build
  scripts for complex msi/msm builds and doing similar things for
  producing Linux RPM builds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dell (6/03 - 3/04)</h3>

<h3><i>Build/SCM Engineer</i></h3>

<p>Joined the 6-person PowerEdge/OpenManage SCM Team, to assist with a
massive migration into ClearCase Multi-Site/UCM, and to
design/implement a CMM Level 2 compliant Build Management Facility.
However, the BMF was shelved and I took on the task of developing
extended monitoring and reporting capability around the ClearCase and
UCM activities.</p>

<p>Current responsibilities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing report-generators for management’s view into the
  activities of teams based in ClearCase MultiSite/UCM.</li>

  <li>These custom reports track development efforts by reporting and
  doing metrics on UCM projects, activities, baselines, streams, and
  components, and provide notification capability for conditions that
  may need attention.</li>

  <li>These reports run daily and are presented on the SCM internal
  website. In addition, users can generate their own reports as
  needed. The report generators, 7k lines of Perl, are in the form of
  several scripts that share a re-usable library of common code.</li>

  <li>Devised an automated regression-test framework, following Kent
  Beck’s Extreme Programming approach of first writing the test,
  making sure it fails, then writing the functionality that will make
  the test succeed. The result is that most of the functionality can
  be regression-tested with a single command, and this has been a big
  help in rapidly evolving these highly visible reports without a lot
  of error.</li>

  <li>As a part of the reporting/monitoring effort, driving a project
  to create a shadow database in SQL Server, for the purpose of
  providing a more general query/drill-down/reporting capability.
  This involves directing the work of a DB developer, and getting
  requirements from three managers.  In addition, suggested using
  Rational ClearQuest as a database engine, to provide this database
  engine capability, have received approval, and we are about to
  engage in an evaluation.</li>

  <li>Have learned how to write and interface custom reports to
  ClearCase Report Builder.</li>

  <li>Run a bi-weekly meeting with the monitoring/reporting
  stakeholders, 6 representatives from various management,
  development, and test areas, for the purpose of iteratively
  gathering requirements, in order to ensure the project satisfies
  it's customer's needs.</li>

  <li>Consult with teams on build issues and build automation
  design.</li>

  <li>In charge of driving the SCM Team’s process improvement
  effort, which involves facilitating a weekly SCM team meeting and
  associated process improvement supervisory activities.</li>

  <li>Identifying needs and writing ClearCase triggers for workflow
  enhancement.</li>

  <li>Setting up ClearCase and NT Server monitoring processes.</li>

  <li>Provided scripts to help teammates with migration efforts, for
  example to correct case errors in element names when doing secondary
  imports from SourceSafe to ClearCase.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Marsh PM Internet Technology Group (9/02 - 11/02)</h3>

<h3><i>Consultant</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Was hired to create the next generation company-wide automated
  software production system. This consisted of two efforts:</li>

  <li>Determine requirements and specify the release engineering
  process.</li>

  <li>develop an automated build system:</li>

  <li>Deterministic: build system completely determines build
  environment so that build proceeds from a known state.</li>

  <li>Repeatable: build state info is archived so that past build
  environments can be re-constructed.</li>

  <li>Accountable: all build states, activities, and outputs are
  recorded in a structured way.</li>

  <li>Extensible: the build system framework is independent of that
  which is built.  A well documented interface permits new build
  inputs and outputs to be spedified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interwoven (9/01 - 8/02)</h3>

<h3><i>Senior Release Engineer</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Designed/implemented an automated dependency-tracking system</li>

  <li>Interwoven needed an accurate and automated way to determine
  exactly what files to include in a service pack or patch.  </li>

  <li>Made major contributions to the design, and did the
  implementation of a system that compares the current build to the
  baseline build, and provides this list of only files that have
  changed in a meaningful way. This meant writing sophisticated
  language-aware tools for one-time initialization of over 100,000
  source files, plus new workflow and build-time production
  modules.</li>

  <li>Wrote these in Perl, such that they could run on both UNIX and
  Win2k platforms.  The work required that I gain an in-depth
  understanding of the internals of both UNIX and Windows versions of
  TeamSite 4.2-5.51, the source file organization, the source code
  branches and branching strategy, source generators and the complex
  Interwoven build system.  </li>

  <li>Since tracking the dependencies required embedding tracking
  information in source and built files, I had to understand compiler
  output formats (C, C++, and Java), as well as understand the syntax
  of XML, HTML, ASP, and JSP files, in order to create a scanner that
  could locate and read the tracking data in built output
  (i.e. executables, Java JAR/WAR/EAR files, etc.) </li>

  <li>As part of this effort I also developed a sophisticated perl
  TeamSite Workflow module for the source file submission
  workflow.</li>

  <li>maintained complex Windows and UNIX service pack
  installers.</li>

  <li>These were being put together by hand, by copying the previous
  service pack’s source. There was no source control.  The UNIX
  service pack install scripts were Bourne shell based.  The Windows
  service pack installers were based in InstallShield 5.5 or 6.3, with
  custom InstallScript. When I started, there were many versions of
  these installers, each with slightly different functionality, and a
  new one was created for each new service pack release.  Devised
  methods and scripts to more effectively reuse existing code.  This
  involved comparing all the installer variations and re-writing large
  parts of the installer code, to support modularized functionality.
  Once the installers were properly modularized, I aggregated all the
  variations into a single configurable installer, which I made
  configurable from property files.  I did this for both UNIX and
  Windows installers.</li>

  <li>During this process I discovered that locked file support was
  not being used in the Windows installers, and I implemented this
  feature, which involved enhancing the way NT services were
  stopped/started versus when to reboot, and how to ensure that
  post-install configuration steps do indeed get postponed until after
  the reboot, if there was one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trilogy Development Group (5/98 - 7/01)</h3>

<h3><i>Build Manager and Installation Engineer</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Led Trilogy’s software build and installation teams and
  trained/mentored 5 other team members.  This team produced builds
  and installers, but also functioned as a company-wide advocate for
  Software Configuration Management/Release Engineering best
  practices.</li>

  <li>Successfully improved Trilogy’s software build process.
  Technology platforms included C++/VB/COM+/Windows, EJB/J2EE, and
  other cross-platform Java.  This was a complex build system that
  produced builds for weekly releases of over 50 products in several
  suites.  When I started, there were 5 build machines and one server.
  I automated many of the manual steps, permitting the system to grow
  to 20 build machines and 6 servers, with web-driven hourly
  builds.</li>

  <li>Helped develop a cutting edge in-house source control system,
  using ClearCase as an engine.  I developed procedures for converting
  source trees from the old systems to the new system.  Contributed to
  the modification of the build system to accommodate the new source
  control system.</li>

  <li>Working with a PhD in SCM and a ClearCase expert as teammates, I
  learned how to administer a complex Rational ClearCase source
  control system consisting of hundreds of VOBs and thousands of
  Views.  I contributed to strategy for VOB automated backups, and
  View and VOB organization. I gained experience with command line
  usage of ClearCase, and how to call it from Perl scripts.  While
  solving a subtle and recurring intermittent NT server crash, I
  became aware of some of ClearCase's limitations, and it's
  implications for our administration strategy.  I participated in
  discussions on trigger strategy, and helped analyze how to implement
  ClearCase Multi-Site between Austin and India.</li>

  <li>Administered large (400,000 files!) PVCS Version Manager
  system</li>

  <li>Administered large (900,000 files!) Visual SourceSafe system.
  As the main company resource, I worked with groups in Core
  Development, Consulting, and several of Trilogy’s spinoffs.</li>

  <li>mentored disparate groups on best usage practices for using the
  main database, and for administering their own database, if
  justified. This included describing VSS design flaws, admonitions
  about the impact that renaming has on repeatability of builds, the
  difference between deleting and purging, the sanctity of the
  archive, how to avoid corrupting the archive, backup strategies,
  when to branch, etc.</li>

  <li>Interfaced the automated build system to VSS databases from the
  command line.</li>

  <li>Wrote conversion scripts when we moved on to another source
  control system.</li>

  <li>Set up customer-specific secure VSS databases, accessed by our
  on-site consultants.</li>

  <li>Upgraded main database to a RAID 5 server, and improved the
  backup strategy. </li>

  <li>Devised best practices for other VSS administrators to
  follow.</li>

  <li>Analyzed and fixed multiple VSS databases.</li>

  <li>Analyzed impact of moving from VSS 4 to VSS 5 to VSS 6.</li>

  <li>Determined the main company VSS database was too large and
  devised the strategy for dividing it into smaller pieces.</li>

  <li>Administered and improved multiple build system NT servers and
  source control NT servers, as well as the 10-20 build machines.</li>

  <li>Developed tools to further automate the build and release
  process</li>

  <li>enhanced complex InstallShield-based Installers.  These
  installers were re-usable, configurable from sets of INI files, and
  consisted of 30,000+ lines of InstallScript.</li>

  <li>Developed Java-based cross-platform installers using
  InstallShield MultPlatform, including writing custom java
  extensions.</li>

  <li>Helped develop Java-based cross-platform installer to replace
  InstalShield MultiPlatform</li>

  <li>Developed automated source escrow generation system</li>

  <li>Helped develop an automated test system.  Trilogy wanted to
  create a web-driven automated test lab to support an Extreme
  Programming inspired automated test framework.  I provided input on
  how best to layer software onto a test machine, starting with a
  ghost image of the desired basic OS, followed by optional
  re-packaged installations of Oracle, Office, etc.</li>

  <li>Served as a resource for the developers and QA engineers on
  source code <li><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Arial,
  sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Integrated third party tools and components
