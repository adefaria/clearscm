  <p>Also served as webmaster for the lab as well as consult on HTML
  questions and design issues. Installed, configured and maintain the
  <a href="http://home.netscape.com"> Netscape </a> Suitespot Servers
  including the Enterprise and Directory servers. Developed several
  web pages and forms for the lab as well as run <a
  href="http://defaria.com/q/">The Unofficial Quicken&reg; Web
  Page</a>.</p>

  <p>I developed an <i><a
  href="http://cllweb.cup.hp.com/productivity/AppServer/"> Application
  Server</a> </i> providing many machines with many software packages
  without the need for individual system administration utilizing
  scripting and NFS heavily.</p>

  <p>Prior to the Productivity Project I worked on COBOL/SoftBench
  product which consists of encapsulating some core <i><a
  href="http://hpcll50.cup.hp.com/"> HP Micro Focus COBOL</a> </i>
  tools using C++ 3.0 and the SoftBench Encapsulator libraries. Also,
  working on porting an X/Motif application to MS Windows 3.1. The
  code is written using C++ 3.0 on both the HP workstation and the PC
  (Borland C++ 3.1).</p>

  <p>Worked in the Ada project on Ada/SoftBench. This project was
  similar to COBOL/SoftBench in that it involved some SoftBench
  encapsulations using a language called edl.</p>

  <p>Worked producing Ada Bindings to Xlib, Xt and Motif. This
  involved using a modified C compiler to translate C header and
  source files to Ada declarations and function prototypes. Using this
  methodology we were able to migrate our product from X11 R3 and
  Motif 1.0 to X11 R4 and Motif 1.1 in one week!</p>

  <p>Worked on a project that produced Ada Bindings to HP-UX, which
  enabled me to get good breath knowledge into all system calls, and
  another binding to Starbase graphical subsystem.</p>

  <p>Performed destructive testing on MPE/XL 1.0-1.3. Wrote several
  programs to stress the OS. Submitted 300+ Service Requests many of
  which appeared on Must Fix lists.</p>
