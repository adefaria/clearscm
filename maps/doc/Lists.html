<h1><font color="#000099">Null List</font></h1>
<p>First the null list. As you know sending a message back to a potential 
spammer will often not work. Many times their return addresses are fake or 
their mail boxes are full. The spammers ISP will often send a message back to 
you to tell you that the email address is invalid or the user's mail box is 
full. You don't care about these messages and they would only create more spam,
though not commerical junk email - unwanted email nonetheless. So you add email
addresses to your null list to tell MAPS to just discard these messages. 
Entries in your null list can be generic in nature. For example, "mail-daemon"
is a common string in a bounced email address from an ISP. Entering 
"mail-daemon" will discard messages from mail-daemon@aol.com as well as
mail-daemon@msn.com. Most users do not care to receive email messages from
mailer daemons.</p>
<h1><font color="#000099">Black List</font></h1>
<p>The black list is for people who you are effectively ignoring. It works
similarly to null lists except that a message telling the sender that you are
ignoring them is returned to the sender. Use this when you want to make sure 
the sender knows that you are ignoring them.</p>
<h1><font color="#000099">White List</font></h1>
<p>The white list is the list of people who are allowed to email you. 
Management of the white list is up to the people who wish to email you, thus
you are not bothered by the hassle of having to maintain a white list. You
can manage your white list, pre-registering a user or say initializing your
white list from your addressbook (called Seeding your White List). But by and
large the white list will be managed by your legitimate email subscribers.
