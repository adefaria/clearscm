# BUGS

## UI Inconsistencies

- [x] **Input Field Styling**: When editing white/black/null lists, there is a mix of input field styles.
    - **Old Style (Square)**: Username, Hit count, Retention.
    - **New Style (Rounded)**: Domain, Comments.

- [x] **Whitelist Output Spacing**: When adding to the white list, single space the output.

- [x] **Search UI Spacing**: Add space after "Mailloop" and the "Search Sender/Subject" section.
- [x] **Search Input Placeholder**: Move "Search Sender/Subject" text into the search input field as a placeholder, similar to "Search my website".

- [ ] **Light Mode Display**: In light mode, `display.cgi` should render content with a white background instead of black.

- [ ] Search mode doesn't seem to find "asjhgdu.com".
