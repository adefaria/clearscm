<font color="#007777" size=+1></b>To register and send your previous
email click <a
href="http://defaria.com/maps/bin/registerform.cgi?userid=$userid;sender=$sender">here</a></b></font>

<p>For your convience you email message is attached to this
message. Note that if you register your previous emails will be
delivered therefore you do not need to resend the message that is
attached to this one.
</div>

<p>My email address is protected by <a
href="http://defaria.com/maps/">Mail Authorization and Permission
System (MAPS)</a>. You must register to email me. Registration is
quick and easy and you need only register once to be added to my
<i>white list</i>, thereafter you should have no problems emailing
me. This is not unlike the authorization procedure in many instant
messaging clients.</p>

<p>This registration process is instantaneous however I reserve the
right to remove you from my <i>white list</i> should you abuse this
privilege.</p>

<div class="notetext">

<p><font class="standout"><b>Special note to solicitors:</b></font>
Please remove my email address from any and all lists that you
maintain or sell. I do not wish to receive any solicitations via
email. I do not give you permission to sell or otherwise use my email
address for any purpose whatsoever. I reserve the right to add you to
my <i>white list</i> as well as to put you on my <i>black list</i>. If
I do wish to receive email from you <b>I</b> will add you to my list
myself. If you register for permission to email me then I will most
likely move you to my <i>black list</i>.</p>
