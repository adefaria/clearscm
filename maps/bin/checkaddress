  # Algorithm change: We now first check to see if the sender is not found
  # in the message and skip it if so. Then we handle if we are the sender
  # and that the from address is formatted properly. Spammers often use 
  # the senders email address (i.e. andrew@defaria.com) as their from address
  # so we check "Andrew DeFaria <Andrew@DeFaria.com>", which they have never
  # forged. This catches a lot of spam actually.
  #
  # Next we check to see if the sender is on our whitelist. If so then we let
  # them in. This allows us to say whitelist josephrosenberg@hotmail.com while
  # still nulllisting all of the other hotmail.com spammers.
  #
  # Next we process blacklisted people as they are also of high priority.
  #
  # Then we process nulllist people.
  #
  # Finally, we handle return processing
  
  # Check whitelist
